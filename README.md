## [Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

Here there are a few topics covered within this repo. A more indeep
explanation of resuls and methodologies as well as the tech stack is offered in the [project
documentation](https://altems-documentation.netlify.app/) _under
major revision_

## Description

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

<!-- Describe your project in brief -->

The project is articulated into 3 parts:

-   set up a new KPI i.e. **Indicatore di Stress** Regionale
-   build ab **ETL** (Extraction, Trasnformation & Loading) pipeline sourcing and merging (then computing Indicatore di Stress) 3 data Sources
-   visualize & design a frontend with [DataWrapper])(https://www.datawrapper.de/) based on aggregated data

the newly created **Indicatore di Stress** will be measuring the overall *stress* undertaken by the SSN (Servizio
Sanitario Nazionale e.g. italian NHS) which results in a combination of the
**Vaccination** and the **Incidence** effects computed per region. Both of the 2 dimensions can reflect hospital **Saturation** and define
criteria according to which regions are labelled as either yellow, orange or red zones (_Zona Gialla_, _Zona Arancione_ e _Zona Rossa_), in compliance with the most
recent orders (D.L. 52/2021). This presumably will help decision makers have a neat undestranding of the current situation and
an **updated perspective** on future scenarios.

The **etl pipeline** joins and cleans up 3 data sources:

-   [pcm-dpc, dati
    regioni](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19/master/dati-regioni/dpc-covid19-ita-regioni.csv)
-   [pcm-dpc, dati statistici di
    riferimento](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19/master/dati-statistici-riferimento/popolazione-istat-regione-range.csv)
-   [COVID 19 open data vaccini, somministrazioni
    vaccini](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/italia/covid19-opendata-vaccini/master/dati/somministrazioni-vaccini-latest.csv)

Data is extracted, cleanded and aggregated every **6 hours**. At the end of the pipeline within the **./data** folder the output file is written in a .csv format.
Methodology and software choices are outlined in the documentation which is currently under _major revision_

Visualizations (barcharts, arrowplots, custom tables and more) are made with 
[Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/) whose data source points to the urls at **./data/data-graph**.

## Installation

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

*You might have noticed the **Back to top** button(if not, please
notice, itâ€™s right there above!). This is a good idea because it makes
this README **easy to navigate.*** If you are willing to install this
project on your machine the recommendend choice is to git pull it from
github:

`git init`

`git clone https://github.com/Data-Network-Lab/indicatore_zona_gialla.git`

Then once you have cloned this repo on your machine you might execute:

``` r
if(!require(renv)){
    install.packages("renv")
}

renv::restore()
```

**Author Disclaimer**: `renv` is *not* a panacea for reproducibility, as
many people believe. Reproducible projects can be made easier with this
tool, which records the versions of R + R packages being used in a
project and provides tools for reinstalling those packages in a project
to their declared versions.

## Usage
